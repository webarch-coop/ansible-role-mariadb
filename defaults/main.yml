# ALL OF THESE VARIABLES ARE OPTIONAL

#
# If the mariadb_root_password variable is not set then nothing will be done to
# the root account login, which, by default, uses a socket for logins and
# doesn't have a password set, generally you will want to omit this option --
# it is only for cases where non-root users need to login to MariaDB as root
# that you need to enable this
#
# If the value of mariadb_root_password is "set" and if /root/.my.cnf exists
# then mariadb_root_password will be read from the file, if the file doesn't
# exist then a new password will be generated and the mariadb_root_password
# variable will be set
# 
# The mariadb_root_password will be written to the database and /root/.my.cnf 
#
# If the mariadb_username is not set then no user account or database will be
# created 
#
# If the mariadb_username is set but the mariadb_database name is not set then
# the mariadb_username will be used as the mariadb_database name 
#
# The mariadb_database will be created, if it didn't already exist
# 
# If a system user account exists with the same name as the mariadb_username
# then mariadb_mycnf is set to ~/.my.cnf
#
# If there is no system user account name that matches the mariadb_username
# then mariadb_mycnf is set to /root/.mariadb_username.my.cnf
#
# If mariadb_mycnf doesn't exists and mariadb_password is not set then a random
# password is generated for mariadb_password  
#
# If mariadb_mycnf does exist then the mariadb_password is loaded from the file
#
# The mariadb_password will be written to mariadb_mycnf and the
# mariadb_username database login updated to match
#
# mariadb_root_password: set
# mariadb_username:
# mariadb_database:
# mariadb_password:
